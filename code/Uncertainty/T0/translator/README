TRANSLATOR: a family of Conformant Planners

CONTENT:
benchmarks: set of benchmarks
generators: for some benchmarks
docs: relevant papers
translator: the planner

For running t0, classical-based translation,
use ./translator-t0.
Most other configurations are available
through ./translator-something
You may want to call ./translator directly.


USAGE:

1. Set var TRANSLATOR_HOME to the translator directory, for example:
export TRANSLATOR_HOME=/home/hlp/translator/translator

2. Test in a directory with pddls, for example
cd translator/benchmarks/ipc5/coins
$TRANSLATOR_HOME/translator-t0 domain.pddl p02.pddl

For verifying plan (using IPC-5 verifier)
$TRANSLATOR_HOME/translator-t0 -c domain.pddl p02.pddl

For running again (overwriting result logs)
$TRANSLATOR_HOME/translator-t0 -f -c domain.pddl p02.pddl

NOTES:

- Requires: python 2.5

- It corresponds to a total reimplementation using OCaml.
Times vary respect to IPC5's and IPC6's.
It now have some support for non-determinism, and syntactical
variations introduced in IPC6.
This version was used for the experiments 
reported in JAIR 2009.

- It assumes a maximum of 2.1 Gb of RAM and 1Mb of stack.
These limits can be changed in $TRANSLATOR_HOME/translator

- It makes use of thid-part research software.
Please, download them of their original site
if you want to do something else than running this planner.
