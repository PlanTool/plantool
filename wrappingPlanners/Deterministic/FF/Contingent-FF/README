This directory contains the C implementation of Metric-FF, as it was
used in the 3rd international planning competition. Build the planner
by typing

make

Which produces an executable named

Cont_FF

Usage should be self-explanatory. Running ff without any parameters
prints out a brief help information about the parameters that are
applicable, which basically come down to specifying the domain and
problem files.

Have fun,
