WELCOME TO GRAPHPLAN

Here is some information on running Graphplan, and on writing your own
domains and problems for it.

RUNNING GRAPHPLAN
-----------------
Decstation object code is in "graphplan" and sparc object code
is in "graphplan.sparc".  If you are accessing this through the Web,
you should set your "load to local disk" option and copy the files you
want to your machine.  The sparc code is a newer version.


To run, just type the program name. It will ask for an "operator" file
that corresponds to a domain in Prodigy, and then it will ask for a
"facts" file that corresponds to a problem in Prodigy.  Our naming
convention is:

	operator files look like: domainname_ops
	facts files look like: domainname_facts[modifier]

Graphplan will then ask for some options.  If you just hit return for
all of them, it will run in its default mode, returning a plan when it
finds one.  Some interesting options: 

Info type: enter "1" if you want to see what the action-levels of the
	graph look like and to see it searching through goal sets.  
	Enter "2" if you want more gory detail.

X viewing: Use this to see an animation of what is going on.  Also
        allows you to save the results to a postscript file.   (For some
	reason, animation makes the DECstation code really huge, so there
	are two versions here for the DECs and the one with animation is
	gzipped.)

Other:	'I' means do a quick check to toss out irrelevant initial
	    conditions.  See, for example, "rocket_factsBIG"

	'L' is a speedup using the reasoning: if I have m goals with
	    the property that I can create at most one of them in a
	    given time step, then I won't be able to find a plan of
	    fewer than m time-steps.  For instance, in a TSP problem
	    if there are m places still to be visited, then it knows
	    it will fail if the current time is < m.
	    NOTE: this option currently interferes with graphplan's
	    completeness check.

	'S' is a speedup using the reasoning: if I have a set of goals
	    at time t, and I've already failed on a SUBSET of these
	    goals at time t, then we're going to fail.  Unfortunately,
	    it seems computationally difficult to make this check, so
	    really what Graphplan does with this option is check
	    whether it has previously failed on some subset of size
	    ONE SMALLER than the current set. 

	'E' turns off some of graphplan's smarts.

We may have some other options available that we are currently playing with.

There are also command line arguments. Type "graphplan -h" to get a list.

	
FILE FORMATS
------------

The format for the operator and fact files can be seen in the
examples. Graphplan takes operator files in three formats: (1) our own
simplified Prodigy-like syntax, (2) Actual Prodigy syntax, and (3) an
older version of (1).  [In format (3), the program assumes that any
precondition not explicitly listed in the effects list is deleted].   If
the file name ends in ".lisp" then the program assumes format (2),
otherwise it assumes format (1), unless the very first character in
the file is "#" in which case it assumes format (3).

(We may at some point do away with format 3).

A few key points:

A. There is currently no inference of "not".  In fact, graphplan just
treats "not" as a string of characters, just like "in" or "have".
If you have an operator A that requires P to be false then
you need to define a new proposition Q that just happens to be
equivalent to (not P).  For instance, if P is, say,
(on-ground <y>), then we might have Q be (not on-ground <y>), or
(not-on-ground <y>) or (up-in-the-air <y>).

B. In formats (1) and (3), the way to delete something is to put the
word "del" as the first element of the list.  E.g., (del on-ground <y>) 
deletes (on-ground <y>).

C. You can't use the underscore character "_" in any token.  I.e., write
"on-ground" instead of "on_ground".

D. It is assumed that if two parameters to a given operator
have different names, like <x>, <y>, then they MUST match to values
with different names.  This will hold until we can figure out what the
right semantics of adding and deleting the same thing should be....

E. In format (2), our parser only understands comments beginning with
a ";".  Also, no inference or control rules, no lisp functions, and no
type heirarchies.


For the format of facts (problem) files, see any of the "_facts" files.
These consist of a list of types (no inheritance) followed by the
starting facts (in a list beginning with the keyword "preconds")
followed by the desired goals (in a list beginning with the keyword
"effects"). 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Description of worlds in this directory:

blocks: standard blocks world. "blocks_ops" in format (3), 
	"blocks_ops.lisp" in format (2).

        the domain "blocks_facts_impossible" is a simple example of
	an interesting unsolvable problem.

fixit:  Russell's flat tire domain.  Some of the names have been changed
	for increased readability (e.g., "not unfastened" --> "fastened")

link30: Link-repeat domain from [VB94]

logistics: logistics domain with trucks and planes, from Prodigy (in
	particular, from [Veloso '92])

mblocks: Like blocks but with multiple robot arms.

monkey: monkey and bananas. From UCPOP from Prodigy.

rocket: rocket domain, allowing for multiple rockets.  See if you can
	figure out what's going on in "rocket_facts_fun".

	In "rocket_factsBIG" is a domain that requires the "I" option
	(graphplan has an internal array that is exceeded without it
	-- we will change the program to be more flexible "real soon")
	
rocket_original: original rocket domain from Prodigy

rocketf: Just like rocket, but now fuel is a cargo.

testcase: a "bicycles and cars" matching problem.  "vehicles" (bikes)
	can only go nearby, but "multiuse" (cars) can go near or far. 

BW.tar.gz: [BW] artificial domains. tar'ed and gzip'ed.

[[The number of "set-creation steps" and the number of "actions tried"
roughly correspond to the number of nodes in a searcher like Prodigy.
"actions tried" is the number of non-noop actions attepted.  The time 
(2.89 secs) is longer than reported in the paper because of the time
used in printing to the screen]]
